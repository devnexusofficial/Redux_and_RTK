# Redux And RTK

# Redux vs Redux Toolkit: What's the Difference?

If you're getting into state management with React, you've likely heard of Redux. But have you heard about Redux Toolkit? In this video, we'll break down the key differences between these two and help you decide which one to use.

## Overview

- **Redux**: A powerful state management library that provides a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It's widely used but often criticized for its verbosity and complexity in setup.
- **Redux Toolkit (RTK)**: The official, recommended way to write Redux logic. RTK simplifies Redux by reducing boilerplate code and providing built-in best practices.

## Key Differences

### 1. **Boilerplate Code**

- **Redux**: Requires you to write a lot of code manually. You'll need to set up action types, action creators, and reducers separately.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Significantly reduces boilerplate. With RTK, you can create slices of state that automatically generate action creators and action types.

### 2. **Store Configuration**

- **Redux**: You manually configure the store, middleware, and Redux DevTools.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Comes with `configureStore`, which automatically sets up the store with good defaults like `redux-thunk` middleware and Redux DevTools.

### 3. **Best Practices**

- **Redux**: It's up to you to follow best practices, like immutability and proper middleware setup.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Enforces best practices out of the box. It uses `Immer` to ensure immutability and includes middleware like `redux-thunk` by default.

### 4. **Handling Asynchronous Logic**

- **Redux**: Requires adding middleware like `redux-thunk` or `redux-saga` manually to handle async operations like API calls.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Includes `createAsyncThunk`, a built-in utility that simplifies working with async logic, making it easier to handle loading states and errors.

### 5. **Learning Curve**

- **Redux**: Has a steeper learning curve due to its verbosity and the need for manual setup.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Easier to learn, especially for beginners, as it abstracts away much of the complexity and provides clear patterns for common use cases.

## When to Use Which?

- **Redux**: Use Redux if you need fine-grained control over your state management or if you're working in a large application that requires a highly customized setup.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Use RTK if you're starting a new project or looking to simplify your Redux codebase. It's the recommended approach for modern Redux development and is ideal for most applications.

## Conclusion

Redux is a powerful tool, but it can be cumbersome to set up and manage. Redux Toolkit addresses many of these pain points, making state management more straightforward and maintainable. If you're just getting started or looking to simplify your Redux usage, Redux Toolkit is the way to go.
